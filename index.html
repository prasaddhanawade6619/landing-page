                    <p>As per my experience, Kesari is one of the best and reputed tours company.
                         Our guide Mr. Aatish Patil has organised and managed tour very well. He has thorough knowledge 
                         of the management of the tour. We had really enjoyed the tour in Shimla and Manali.
                          He had conducted some activities to keep the tourist happy. All hotels provided by Kesari were clean and staff was very polite.

                        All hotels and transportation arrangements were excellent. Though we had faced some problems with hotel at Kedarnath you handled it swiftly and efficiently. Thanks for your support and prompt response.
                        The driver (Mahesh) just was very cooperative, polite and friendly. His driving skills were excellent and safe. </p>
